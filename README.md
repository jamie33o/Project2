- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed


- Manual tests were also performed to ensure the website was accessible as possible and an accessibility issue was identified.

  - Issue #1: Some buttons had no text

    - Fix: added aria-label.


### LightHouse Testing

![index.html](docs/readme_images/lighthouse.png)


### Functional Testing

**Navigation Links**

Testing was performed to ensure all navigation links on the respective pages, navigated to the correct pages as per design. This was done by clicking on the navigation links on each page.

| Navigation Link   | Page to Load    |
| ---------------   | --------------- |
| Home              | index.html      |
| Gallery           | gallery.html    |
| Question/add info | question-add-info.html    |

Links on all pages navigated to the correct pages as exptected.

**Form Testing**

The form on the home page was tested to ensure it functioned as expected when correct data was input and when incorrect data was input. The following test scenarios were covered:

_Scenario One - Correct Inputs_

Steps to test:

1. Navigate to [History of Michael Collins - Questions/Add info](https://jamie33o.github.io/history-of-michael-collins/questions-add-info.html)
2. Scroll down to the form and input the following data:
   - Name: John doe
   - Email: doe.john@test.com
   - Comment: This is a test.
3. Click Submit
4. User should be redirected to thank-you.html confirmation page

Expected:

Form submits with no warnings or errors and user is redirected to contact.html confirmation page.

Actual:

Website behaved as expected with no errors or warnings and redirected to contact.html.

_Scenario Two - Missing Required Field_

Steps to test:

1. Navigate to [History of Michael Collins - Questions/Add info](https://jamie33o.github.io/history-of-michael-collins/questions-add-info.html)
2. Scroll down to the form and input the following data:
   - Name:
   - Email: doe.john@test.com
   - Comment: This is a test.
3. Click Submit

Expected:

The form does not submit and an Error is displayed to tell the user that the field is required.

Actual:

Website behaved as expected, error message was displayed and the form did not submit.


### JavaScript Validation

The JS Hint JavaScript Validation Service was used to validate the JavaScript code on the website. The results below show three code warnings related to "Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics". Or undeclared Variables as these are dynamic variables or are declared in the main script.js file or relate to the EmailJS. I'm flagging these for future improvement:

#### javascript.js
**Metrics**

- There are 60 functions in this file.
- Function with the largest signature take 4 arguments, while the median is 0.
- Largest function has 21 statements in it, while the median is 4.
- The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 7 while the median is 1.

**Four warnings:**

- 'async functions' is only available in ES8 (use 'esversion: 8').
- 258	'async functions' is only available in ES8 (use 'esversion: 8').
- 330	'async functions' is only available in ES8 (use 'esversion: 8').
- 382	'async functions' is only available in ES8 (use 'esversion: 8').

**One undefined variable**

- 2	Parse
- 3	Parse
- 235	Parse
- 264	Parse
- 297	Parse
- 301	Parse
- 336	Parse
- 384	Parse

### Unfixed Bugs

1. The form section is currently not able to be submitted as it needs javascript and python to send the data and as this website is for education purposes we have not learnt these languages yet, but will be updated in the future.

2. On gallery.html lighthouse results for best practices are 85% because of embeded youtube videos.
