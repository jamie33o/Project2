### Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

All forms have associated labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users
Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines
Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
HTML page lang attribute has been set
Aria properties have been implemented correctly
WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed


Manual tests were also performed to ensure the website was accessible as possible and an accessibility issue was identified.

Issue #1: Social media links in the footer had no text to explain what they link to.

### LightHouse Testing

![Homepage](docs/testing/lighthouse-homepage.png)
![gallery](docs/testing/lighthouse-gallery.png)
![question/add info](docs/testing/lighthouse-form-page.png)

### Functional Testing

**Navigation Links**

Testing was performed to ensure all navigation links on the respective pages, navigated to the correct pages as per design. This was done by clicking on the navigation links on each page.

| Navigation Link   | Page to Load    |
| ---------------   | --------------- |
| Home              | index.html      |
| Gallery           | gallery.html    |
| Question/add info | question-add-info.html    |

Links on all pages navigated to the correct pages as exptected.

**Form Testing**

The form on the home page was tested to ensure it functioned as expected when correct data was input and when incorrect data was input. The following test scenarios were covered:

_Scenario One - Correct Inputs_

Steps to test:

1. Navigate to [History of Michael Collins - Questions/Add info](https://jamie33o.github.io/history-of-michael-collins/questions-add-info.html)
2. Scroll down to the form and input the following data:
   - Name: John doe
   - Email: doe.john@test.com
   - Comment: This is a test.
3. Click Submit
4. User should be redirected to thank-you.html confirmation page

Expected:

Form submits with no warnings or errors and user is redirected to contact.html confirmation page.

Actual:

Website behaved as expected with no errors or warnings and redirected to contact.html.

_Scenario Two - Missing Required Field_

Steps to test:

1. Navigate to [History of Michael Collins - Questions/Add info](https://jamie33o.github.io/history-of-michael-collins/questions-add-info.html)
2. Scroll down to the form and input the following data:
   - Name:
   - Email: doe.john@test.com
   - Comment: This is a test.
3. Click Submit

Expected:

The form does not submit and an Error is displayed to tell the user that the field is required.

Actual:

Website behaved as expected, error message was displayed and the form did not submit.


**Footer Social Media Icons / Links**

Testing was performed on the Font Awesome Social Media icons in the footer to ensure that each one opened in a new tab and that each one had a hover affect of the orange branding color.

Each item opened a new tab when clicked as expected and correct hover color was present.


### Unfixed Bugs

1. The form section is currently not able to be submitted as it needs javascript and python to send the data and as this website is for education purposes we have not learnt these languages yet, but will be updated in the future.

2. On gallery.html lighthouse results for best practices are 85% because of embeded youtube videos.
